# Photo Watermark Tool - Project Status

## âœ… Migration to UV Complete

The project has been successfully migrated to use [UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for modern Python dependency management.

### What's New

#### ðŸ”§ Project Configuration
- **`pyproject.toml`** - Modern Python project configuration with UV support
- **`uv.lock`** - Locked dependencies for reproducible builds
- **`install_uv.sh`** - Automated installation script for UV setup

#### ðŸ“¦ Dependency Management
- **Fast Installation**: UV provides 10-100x faster dependency resolution
- **Reliable**: Locked dependencies ensure consistent environments
- **Space Efficient**: Shared cache across projects
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

#### ðŸš€ Usage Options

**Option 1: Using `uv run` (Recommended)**
```bash
uv run photo_watermark.py /path/to/photos --font-size 64 --color red
```

**Option 2: Virtual Environment**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python photo_watermark.py /path/to/photos
```

**Option 3: Traditional pip (Still supported)**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python photo_watermark.py /path/to/photos
```

### Files Modified/Added

#### New Files
- `pyproject.toml` - UV project configuration
- `uv.lock` - Dependency lock file
- `install_uv.sh` - UV installation script
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` - This status file

#### Updated Files
- `README.md` - Enhanced with UV instructions and examples
- `requirements.txt` - Maintained for backward compatibility

#### Original Files (Unchanged)
- `photo_watermark.py` - Main application logic
- `install.sh` - Original pip-based installation
- `example_photos/` - Test photos directory

### Testing Results

âœ… **UV Run**: Successfully executes with `uv run photo_watermark.py`
âœ… **Virtual Environment**: Works with activated `.venv`
âœ… **Dependencies**: Pillow installed and functioning
âœ… **Help Command**: All command-line arguments working
âœ… **Example Processing**: Directory scanning and image processing working

### Performance Benefits

- **Installation Speed**: ~10x faster than pip
- **Dependency Resolution**: ~100x faster for complex dependency trees
- **Disk Space**: Shared cache reduces duplicate packages
- **Reproducibility**: Locked dependencies ensure consistent behavior

### Backward Compatibility

The project maintains full backward compatibility:
- Traditional pip installation still works
- `requirements.txt` file preserved
- Original `install.sh` script maintained
- No breaking changes to the application code

## ðŸŽ¯ Ready for Production

The project is now ready for use with modern Python packaging standards and UV's fast, reliable dependency management. Users can choose between the modern UV approach or traditional pip installation based on their preferences and environment constraints.
