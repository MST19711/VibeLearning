# Universal Binary Verification

## ✅ Application Architecture Status

The Photo Watermark application has been successfully built as a **universal binary** that supports both ARM64 (Apple Silicon) and x86_64 (Intel) architectures.

### Verification Results

#### Main Application Binary
```
Architectures in the fat file: x86_64 arm64
```

#### Framework Components
- **App.framework**: `x86_64 arm64`
- **FlutterMacOS.framework**: `x86_64 arm64`
- **path_provider_foundation.framework**: `x86_64 arm64`

### What This Means

✅ **Native ARM64 Support**: Runs natively on Apple Silicon Macs (M1, M2, M3, etc.)  
✅ **Native x86_64 Support**: Runs natively on Intel Macs  
✅ **No Rosetta 2 Required**: The app automatically uses the appropriate native architecture  
✅ **Optimal Performance**: Maximum performance on both architecture types  

### Build Location
The universal binary is located at:
```
build/macos/Build/Products/Release/photo_watermark.app
```

### File Size
The universal binary is approximately 52.6MB, which includes both architectures.

### Distribution
This single application bundle can be distributed to users with both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs, providing optimal performance on both platforms without any additional configuration required.
